# STSAigismodTranslations
This repository is for translating the Aigis mod from Slay the Spire. Link to the mod in Steam Workshop https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2581165647&searchtext=

Take the english text as a starting base when translating.

NOTE (april 9 2022): for now, itÂ´s not necessary to translate the following cards starting at Cornelia, at around the line 3085 of the Card-Strings file.
                     This also applies to powers, strings and other things not implemented currently in the mod.

Once you finish translating the text, send a Pull request and the translation will be added to the mod.
